# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup Complete

## What's Been Created

I've set up a complete CI/CD pipeline for your project with the following workflows:

### 1. Pull Request Testing (`pr-tests.yml`)
- **Triggers**: When PRs are opened/updated targeting `main`
- **Actions**: Runs unit tests and posts results as PR comments
- **Purpose**: Ensure code quality before merging

### 2. Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)  
- **Triggers**: Push to `main` or `release/*` branches
- **Actions**: Comprehensive testing with artifact uploads
- **Purpose**: Continuous validation of main branches

### 3. Release Automation (`release.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to `main` branch (after PR merge)
- **Actions**: 
  - Auto-bump patch version (if not manually changed)
  - Build Windows executable and installer
  - Create release branch (`release/vX.Y.Z`)
  - Create GitHub release with built artifacts
- **Purpose**: Automated releases with every merge to main

### 4. Release Branch Testing (`release-branch.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Activity on `release/*` branches
- **Actions**: Testing and building on release branches
- **Purpose**: Validate release branches before final release

## Version Management System

### Automatic Patch Bumping
- If you merge a PR without changing `.version`, the patch number auto-increments
- Example: `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`

### Manual Version Control
- Update `.version` file in your PR to set specific version
- Example: Change to `2.0.0` for major release

### What Happens on Merge to Main
1. Check if version was manually changed
2. If not, auto-bump patch version
3. Run all 61 unit tests
4. Build Windows executable and installer
5. Create release branch: `release/vX.Y.Z`
6. Create Git tag: `vX.Y.Z`
7. Create GitHub release with:
   - `PortalReceiptsApp_Setup_vX.Y.Z.exe` (Windows installer)
   - `PortalReceiptsApp_vX.Y.Z_Release.zip` (Complete package)

## Files Created
- `.github/workflows/pr-tests.yml` - PR testing
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Continuous integration
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Release automation
- `.github/workflows/release-branch.yml` - Release branch testing
- `.github/workflows/README.md` - Workflow documentation
- `.version` - Version tracking file (currently: 1.0.0)

## Next Steps

### 1. Repository Setup (Required)
```bash
# Commit the new workflows
git add .github/ .version
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Repository Settings (Recommended)
- Go to Settings → Actions → General
- Ensure workflows have write permissions
- Set up branch protection on `main`:
  - Require PR reviews
  - Require status checks (unit tests)

### 3. Test the System
- Create a test PR with a small change
- Merge it to see the full release process in action

### 4. Usage Examples

**For regular updates** (auto patch bump):
1. Make changes, create PR
2. Merge to main
3. Version automatically goes 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
4. Release created automatically

**For major/minor releases**:
1. Update `.version` to "1.1.0" or "2.0.0"
2. Create PR with changes
3. Merge to main
4. Release created with your specified version

## What This Achieves

✅ **Automated Testing**: Every PR and merge runs all unit tests  
✅ **Automated Releases**: Every merge to main creates a release  
✅ **Version Management**: Automatic patch bumping or manual control  
✅ **Professional Releases**: Windows installer + complete packages  
✅ **Release Branches**: Organized release branch structure  
✅ **Artifact Management**: All builds stored and accessible  

Your development workflow is now fully automated from code change to production release!
